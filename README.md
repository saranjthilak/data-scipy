# Data SciPy: Advanced Mathematical Operations with SciPy

Welcome to the **Data SciPy** repository! This project demonstrates the application of the SciPy library for advanced mathematical computations in Python. SciPy is an essential tool for data analysts and scientists, extending NumPy's capabilities to solve complex mathematical problems efficiently.

## üìö Overview

SciPy is a powerful library that builds on NumPy, providing a wide range of functions for:

- **Optimization**: Finding minima and maxima of functions.
- **Linear Algebra**: Advanced matrix operations beyond `numpy.linalg`.
- **Differential Equations**: Solving ordinary differential equations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing statistical tests and distributions.
- **Image Processing**: Manipulating and analyzing images.
- **Signal Processing**: Filtering and analyzing signals.

This repository includes practical examples and exercises to help you get hands-on experience with SciPy's features.

## üîß Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
## üìÅ Repository Structure

03-scipy.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing various SciPy examples and exercises.

Makefile: Automation script for setting up the environment and running tests.

tests/: Directory containing unit tests for the implemented functions.
