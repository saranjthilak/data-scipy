# Data SciPy: Advanced Mathematical Operations with SciPy

Welcome to the **Data SciPy** repository! This project demonstrates the application of the SciPy library for advanced mathematical computations in Python. SciPy is an essential tool for data analysts and scientists, extending NumPy's capabilities to solve complex mathematical problems efficiently.

## ðŸ“š Overview

SciPy is a powerful library that builds on NumPy, providing a wide range of functions for:

- **Optimization**: Finding minima and maxima of functions.
- **Linear Algebra**: Advanced matrix operations beyond `numpy.linalg`.
- **Differential Equations**: Solving ordinary differential equations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing statistical tests and distributions.
- **Image Processing**: Manipulating and analyzing images.
- **Signal Processing**: Filtering and analyzing signals.

This repository includes practical examples and exercises to help you get hands-on experience with SciPy's features.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:



Scipy is powerful because it's a non-specialized mathematical tool offering infinite possibilities. Although we won't use it a lot in the bootcamp, preferring more specific and user-friendly libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine-learning, it's important to know SciPy for your culture and progress later on!

Don't forget to `pip install scipy` before starting the challenge. When you are ready, open the `03-scipy.ipynb` notebook in this folder for a relaxing and guided introduction to the library.
